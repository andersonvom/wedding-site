We request only your company on our wedding day. Truth be told, we
already have all of the pots and pans and mismatched linens one could
desire! If you do wish to gift, we would be honored with a donation to
any of the organizations listed below. They advocate for causes that we
care about.

  non-governmental organization that fights for a better life for
  abandoned animals in Fortaleza [Brazil]."
