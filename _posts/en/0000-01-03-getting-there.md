## Airports

There are three airports serving the DC area: Reagan National Airport
(DCA), Dulles International Airport (IAD), and Baltimore-Washington
International Airport (BWI).

DCA or IAD are the most convenient options since they're closer to DC.
BWI is already close to Baltimore, so transportation to/from the airport
will not only be costlier but will take longer.

DCA has a metro station at the airport. For IAD, there's a bus that
takes you to a metro station ([Reston][] - $5 or [Rosslyn][] - $7), but
the total travel time will be around 2h30min. A cab ride will cost
between $60 and $80 and will take around 30min. [SuperShuttle][] will
cost around $36.

For BWI your options are only SuperShuttle for $55 and cabs for $130.
Total travel time will be over 1h.


## Metro

Fares cost between $1.75 and $5.90, depending on the day/hour. It can
take significantly longer to ride the metro on the weekends. Weekdays
are fine.

You'll need to buy a [SmartTrip card][smarttrip] to ride the metro. They
can be purchased at any metro station and cost $2. There's also an app
to see arrival times in real time for [android][] e [ios][].


## Uber

[Uber][] is also very convenient and widely available.
