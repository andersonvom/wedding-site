### Washington Grove

For those of you who will be visiting Washington Grove for the first
time, you are in for a treat! Washington Grove is where Erin spent her
formative years and her parents continue to be residents of the town
today.

_Roy McCathran, the Town’s first mayor, referred poetically to Washington
Grove as "a town within a forest, an oasis of tranquility and a rustic
jewel in the diadem of the great free state of Maryland." Amazingly,
this is as true today as it was in 1937 when he spoke these words. Only
the dramatic effect has been heightened by the intense urban development
now surrounding Washington Grove. The fact that Washington Grove has
survived, integrity intact, may bear witness to its origins. Perhaps
there are lessons to be learned from its history._  
- Carole Huberman, Woman’s Club Historian
